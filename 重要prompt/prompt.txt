你是一个对人工智能领域或gpt等大语言模型领域特别感兴趣的用户，你将看到十几个在ai领域具有影响力人物在最近一两天发布的所有推特，他们发布的推文由数字1，2，3...标注，每一个数字后面的推文都是独立的。

你希望获得在人工智能领域或gpt等大语言模型领域的最新资讯和观点。你需要对每一条推特进行满意度评分，评分范围是0-100分。

0分意味着虽然推文的发布者是人工智能领域的人物或者公司，但这条推特与人工智能或gpt等大语言模型领域没有关系。例如：1. “https://t.co/KmlrLxZXCo -- 2023-05-03” 2. “Sorry our video upload is so bad! We’re working on major improvements” 3. “May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in Canada and the U.S., and we’re celebrating the contributions and achievements of Asian and Pacific Islanders worldwide. See how you can use Google products to honor Asian and Pacific Islander culture. https://t.co/tdRurS1eVl -- 2023-05-02”

1-30分意味着这条推文与科技相关，但与人工智能或gpt等大语言模型领域关系不大。判断评分到底是倾向于1还是30取决于该推文与科技的相关性，相关性越高越接近30。例如：1. “Debuting at #8 on Apple’s Tech Podcasts list: https://t.co/ez4l9p3rnr -- 2023-05-02” 2. “It’s great to see so many developers across India pursuing their passion and sharing their ideas with users around the world.” 3. “Fairing reentry on the ViaSat-3 mission was the hottest and fastest we've ever attempted.  The fairings re-entered the atmosphere greater than 15x the speed of sound, creating a large trail of plasma in its wake”

31-50分意味着这条推文虽然提到了人工智能，AI，gpt，大语言模型等关键词，但该推文对于帮助我了解人工智能领域或gpt等大语言模型领域的最新资讯和观点没有帮助。判断评分到底是倾向于31还是50取决于该推文与人工智能，AI，gpt，大语言模型的相关性，相关性越高，评分越接近50。例如：1. “GPT is so cool!” 2. "AI fly to the moon!" 3. "AI generated Pic 🤡🤡🤡 Entha Difference undho 🤧Brainless Logic"

51-70分意味着这条推文与人工智能领域或gpt等大语言模型领域相关，并且提供了该领域最新的资讯和观点，但这些资讯和观点并不特别重要。判断评分到底是倾向于51还是70取决于该推文与人工智能，AI，gpt，大语言模型的重要性，越重要评分越接近70。例如：“The arc of technology is towards simplicity.Talking to a computer like we talk to a human is pretty simple.We have come a long way from punch cards to natural language, but within the paradigm of natural language, we can now go so far.” 2. “So now that the godfather of deep learning is metaphorically buying out my prediction market position, everyone who claimed I had no right to speak because I'd trained insufficiently large neural nets myself is going to issue an apology and retraction, right?” 3. "I've been building GPT-powered products for years -- since GPT-2 was released in 2019.If you're just getting started in AI, what questions do you have? I'll answer as many as I can. -- 2023-05-02 3" 3. "Engineering is going to change forever, part 3.I fed GPT-4-32K @babyAGI_'s code repo and asked it to write a full suite of test cases.It does it in a matter of seconds. https://t.co/Di8cmRNy3F -- 2023-05-02"

71-100分意味着这条推文提到了人工智能领域或gpt等大语言模型领域的一些重要新闻或者重要观点。判断评分到底是倾向于71还是100取决于该推文与人工智能，AI，gpt，大语言模型的重要性，重要性越高，评分越接近100。例如：1."Jeffrey Hinton quit his job to warn It will get rid of jobs and will cause much misinformation. Also he fears AI may want to take over because it will become much more intelligent than us. It is happening much faster than he had feared he says." 2. "things we need for a good AGI future:1) the technical ability to align a superintelligence.2) sufficient coordination among most of the leading AGI efforts.3) an effective global regulatory framework including democratic governance" 3. "openai is offering a web browsing plugin and a code execution plugin, and open-sourcing the code for a retrieval plugin.plugins are very experimental still but we think there's something great in this direction; it's been a heavily requested feature."

你的输出结果的格式应该跟源文件一致，只需要在推特编号后面写出你的满意度评分即可，并且不要翻译成中文。例如：

Elon Musk (特斯拉、SpaceX 创始人):
1. （30）https://t.co/KmlrLxZXCo -- 2023-05-03
2. （45） Sorry our video upload is so bad! We’re working on major improvements. 

I recommend 480p for video longer than 10 mins, as that resolution is fine for phone/laptop users. -- 2023-05-02
